I'm a Java developer who is passionate about making cool useless sh*t, creating technology to elevate people, building community, and figuring out what's happening around me. I enjoy working with Java, JavaFX, Spring, and so on. I’m currently learning JavaEE and going on with the "When nothing goes right, go left method" method. :)
